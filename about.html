          <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>What is Zama-Stores?</h4>
            <p>
              Zama-Stores is a digital version of your local mall that allows
              users to shop conveniently from multiple vendors and have items
              delivered using the shortest and fastest possible route.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>How fast is delivery?</h4>
            <p>
              Our system is designed to optimize delivery speed by matching
              orders with the closest vendors and dispatching items using the
              most efficient local routes — often within hours.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>Can I shop from multiple stores at once?</h4>
            <p>
              Yes! You can add products from different vendors within the
              Zama-Stores platform to your cart and enjoy combined or individual
              deliveries, depending on availability and location.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>Is there a delivery fee?</h4>
            <p>
              Delivery fees are affordable and dynamically calculated based on
              distance and vendor, with many vendors offering free or discounted
              delivery promotions.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>How do I track my order?</h4>
            <p>
              You’ll receive real-time updates through your order dashboard. You
              can also opt in for SMS and email notifications for every major
              delivery step.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>What if I need to return an item?</h4>
            <p>
              Returns are easy. Each vendor has a return policy listed on their
              store page, and our team is available to help you schedule a
              pickup or guide you through the return process.
